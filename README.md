# üìä Sales Trend Analysis using SQL

## üìÅ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an online sales dataset to extract monthly trends in **revenue**, **order volume**, and **category/region-based breakdowns** using SQL queries. The data was cleaned, imported, and processed in **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** using advanced aggregation and date-time functions.
